      <h3>What is PBIS?</h3>
      <p>Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is a proactive approach to improving school climate and student behavior. It focuses on teaching expected behaviors and rewarding positive actions. Our school uses PBIS to create a safe, respectful, and supportive learning environment for all students. Through Tiered supports, every child receives the interventions they need to succeed. Together, we foster a culture of respect, responsibility, and kindness.</p>

    <h2>PBIS Tiers Overview</h2>
    <h3>Tier 1 - Universal Supports</h3>
    <p>All students receive proactive teaching of behavioral expectations and schoolwide positive reinforcement. 
*Behavior-Specific Praise - Directing a positive statement toward a student or group of students that acknowledges a desired behavior in specific, observable, and measurable terms. When a teacher or para calls a student’s name and follows with a particular behavior that they are doing correctly after instructions were given, it brings a positive response to the classroom.  Other students follow this behavior to receive the same praise or just to be part of the group/class.      
Precorrection - Determining when challenging behaviors tend to occur and then making adjustments to the classroom environment or providing support for students, both to prevent those behaviors from happening and to facilitate more appropriate behavior. Tracking the students' undesired behaviors and when or what the trigger is when the disruptive, negative etc behavior happens. Then precorrection is used before the instruction is given, before the corrective action is given, before the transition is made, whatever the trigger is for the student.                                                                 
*Active Supervision - Frequently and intentionally monitoring students, during instructional and non-instructional periods, to reinforce behavior expectations and anticipate or prevent undesired behaviors. Walking around the classroom and engaging with the students and showing the care you have for each one is one of the ways I use when in the class or any location we may be at during the school day.                                                                                                   *High-Probability (High-p) Requests - Making a series of requests to which a student is highly likely to respond (high-p requests) before providing a request to which a student infrequently or never responds (low-p request) to increase the student’s ability to meet expectations. After you track, evaluate, and know each student and what request or behavior they repeat that is not appropriate for the classroom, you can use the high-to-low probability request method that will break down the low probability request into steps that get them to the place or action that is desired by the teacher. *Opportunities to Respond (OTR) - Giving students frequent chances to answer questions or prompts in a set amount of time to promote and reinforce student participation and engagement. When the teacher gives each student an equal amount of time to answer or talk, it gives the child a sense of belonging and less time to get off task.                        *Choice Making - Providing structured options to facilitate a student’s ability to follow an instructional or behavioral request.  Offering students choices for non-preferred tasks or tasks that they find challenging gives them more control over their own learning and fosters independence. I can't say it any better than the information found    (https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/bi2-elem/cresource/q1/p07/#content)</p>
    <h3>Tier 2 - Targeted Supports</h3>
    <p>Students requiring additional support receive small group interventions and progress monitoring. Tier 2 provides additional support for students who do not respond adequately to universal (Tier 1) interventions. These students are at risk for behavioral challenges and need targeted, more focused strategies to succeed.</p>
<h3>Tier 3 - Intensive Supports</h3>
    <p>Individualized interventions are provided for students with significant behavioral challenges, including functional behavior assessments. Tier 3 systems are meant to provide individualized and intensive interventions and support to students to ensure positive behavioral outcomes. Schools are shifting their focus from compliance with regulations to achieving positive student outcomes. (https://flpbis.cbcs.usf.edu/tiers/tier3.html)
Tier 3 interventions represent the most intensive level of academic and behavioral support within a Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework. These interventions are highly individualized, data-driven, and designed for students who have not responded adequately to Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) supports.
In my classroom and school, Tier 3 would be evident through small-group or one-on-one instruction tailored specifically to a student’s unique needs. For example, a student struggling significantly with reading comprehension might receive daily, individualized tutoring using specialized strategies and materials aligned with evidence-based practices. Progress monitoring would occur frequently, often weekly, to ensure interventions are effective and adjusted as needed.
At the school level, Tier 3 involves a collaborative approach with specialists such as special educators, school psychologists, and interventionists who contribute expertise to develop and implement intensive intervention plans. Documentation and data collection are critical, ensuring decisions are objective and responsive.
Tier 3 also requires ongoing communication with families to engage them as partners in supporting the student’s growth. This might include regular meetings to review progress and adjust goals.
Overall, Tier 3 is characterized by its intensity, personalization, and responsiveness. It reflects a deep commitment to equity, ensuring that all students receive the support necessary to succeed. In my classroom, this would mean carefully identifying students who need this level of support, delivering targeted instruction with fidelity, and continually evaluating outcomes to make timely adjustments.
